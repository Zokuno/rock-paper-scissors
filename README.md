THOUGHTS

This is my first major project in my coding journey and I'm pretty happy with how it turned out - it's also my first README entry!

I made this as part of 'The Odin Project' online Foundations course, the instructions were to create a functioning rock, paper, scissors game where after 5 rounds it announces a winner - I didn't do that. I got wrapped up in making things looking nice and getting the core game functions working; the result? A never ending game of rock, paper, scissors. 

At some point I intend on coming back and making the code look nicer as I'm aware it's not necessarily beautiful code. There are sections of clunky code that exist because I simply don't have the knowledge to streamline it, others because it just works and I'd rather continue learning.

FUTURE FEATURES
- Play 5 rounds and announce a winner, but why stop there? I'd like something akin to a drop down menu "round amount" selector, or the user could input the amount of rounds they want to play.
- Add text boxes/bubbles above the large icons which "trash talk" each other. How this will work is to be decided, I just think it'll be cutely/cringely funny.
- "Borrow" from Pokemon and have Gen 1 attack animations between large icons (you know, the pokemon sprite just "rams" the other").
- Make the buttons look prettier - they're very basic. 
- Do something with the text in the centre blue console. I feel like it can be hard and/or annoying to read.
